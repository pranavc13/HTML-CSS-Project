This project is the clone of Microsoft Home-Page, Performed under the guidance od Traversy Media...
I used various concepts of CSS such as:
1) Grid: To place the cards accordingly and clealry;

2) Flex box: to align the different elements properly; 
  By using the properties such as:
    *Flex-direction
    *Justify-content 

3) The hover transition, reducing the opacity to 0.9 while hovering on the buttons,

4) Using the lists concept for the Navigation bar and footer;
5) Using the Cdn of font awesome to connect to the nearest server.
6) Here are the screenshots of the designed web-page.
